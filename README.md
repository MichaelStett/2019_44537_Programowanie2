# __The Arena__
Project for passing the subject on college 2nd semester.

## 1. _Premise_
The project was aimed at creating a simple turn-based console game.

## 2. _What is done already_

`Under construction`

## 3. _Manual_
You start the game and can download previously saved file if it exist.
Otherwise you can create your Character basing on its:

* __Races__:
    * _Human_
    * _Orc_
    * _Elf_
    * _Dwarf_
* __Classes__:
    * _Mage_
    * _Battlemage_
    * _Worrior_
    * _Acrobat_
    * _Archer_
    * _Bard_

Than the menu appears.

Now you can see your character stats.

Stats order: _Level_, _Health_, _Attack_, _Defense_, _Speed_, _Luck_, _Gold_, _ExpPoints_, _ExpCap_.

You can choose to:
* __Arena__ <sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> - a place where you can fight.
* __Market__ <sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> - `Currently under construction`
* __Save & Exit__ <sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup> - name says all about it
